= About the project =

[MadWimax] is a reverse-engineered linux driver for Mobile Wimax (802.16e) devices based on Samsung CMC-730 chip. These devices are currently supported:

  * [SwcU200 Samsung SWC-U200]

  * [SwcE100 Samsung SWC-E100]

  * [SwmS10R Samsung SWM-S10R] (built in [Nc10 Samsung NC-10] netbook)

Project is named after [http://madwifi-project.org/wiki MadWifi].

The driver is completely user-space. There are a few reasons for that:

  * portability

    It should run gracefully on every kernel from 2.4. It can be ported to other platforms with some effort.

  * ease of development

    Debugging is easy in user-space.

  * security

    You cannot crash kernel due to a bug in the user-space code (well, it's supposed to be this way :) ).

There is also a [http://git.altlinux.org/people/silicium/packages/kernel-source-u200.git project] to port [MadWimax] to Linux kernel.

The driver uses [http://libusb.wiki.sourceforge.net/Libusb1.0 libusb-1.0 library] to communicate to the device. This library helps a lot to write a user-space USB driver and also supports the required asynchronous transfers. Unfortunately it works under Linux only at the moment. Mac OS X port is ongoing.

Linux TUN/TAP driver is used for user-space Ethernet interface.
