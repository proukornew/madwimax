The most important and never-ending task of the project is decrypting Samsung CMC-730 [USB protocol](UsbProtocol.md). There are several sources of information and ways to extract it:

  * Windows drivers
    * you can disassemble them
    * you can sniff the traffic with [USB sniffer](http://www.pcausa.com/Utilities/UsbSnoop/default.htm) and analize the logs
  * firmwares of the supported devices can also be disassembled
